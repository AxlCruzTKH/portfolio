    "    The term was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, a pioneer in the field of ML. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    He had developed an algorithm which was able to play a game of checkers. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    He himself was not very good at checkers,\n",
    "    but he was able to develop an algorithm would could analyze board states and then make a decision based of an analysis of the current board position, on where to move a game piece. This algorithm was able to beat him and eventually, beat amateur players.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Why?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The upside was that his algorithm could plays thousands of games. A human might be able to play that many games, but not within the same ime period, and not every human has the patience to play thousands upon thousands of games. He was able to use computers to simulate a game, and then run his algorithm over and over again, to see more board states, and to \"learn\" what was a good move and what wasn't.\n",

    "    The definition is as follows,\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This is to say, that as we feed in some information (E), the computer can execute some task (T), and the performance of its execution can be measured by some statistic (P). As we give it more information (E) the performance measure (P) with regards to the task (T) should improve."
